## Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Apollo Client** - GraphQL client
- **HLS.js** - HTML5 video player with adaptive streaming
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Modern utility-first CSS framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Your video processing backend running on `http://localhost:3000`

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

### Uploading Videos

1. Click on the "ðŸ“¤ Upload Video" tab
2. Drag and drop a video file onto the upload area or click to browse
3. The client will automatically:
   - Initiate a multipart upload
   - Split the file into 5MB chunks
   - Upload each chunk with progress tracking
   - Complete the upload when finished

### Viewing Videos

1. Click on the "ðŸ“¹ My Videos" tab
2. View all uploaded videos with their current status:
   - **UPLOADING**: File is being uploaded
   - **TRANSCODING**: Video is being processed
   - **READY**: Video is ready for playback
   - **ERROR**: Something went wrong

## API Integration

The client integrates with your GraphQL backend using the following mutations:

- `initiateMultipartUpload` - Start a new multipart upload
- `generateUploadPartUrl` - Get presigned URLs for each chunk
- `completeMultipartUpload` - Finalize the upload
- `abortMultipartUpload` - Cancel an upload in progress

And queries:

- `videos` - Get all uploaded videos

## Configuration

### GraphQL Backend

The client is configured to connect to your backend at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`. To change this, update the URI in `src/lib/apollo.ts`:

```typescript
const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: "http://your-backend-url:port/graphql",
});
```

### CDN Configuration for Video Streaming

The video player uses HLS.js for adaptive streaming and fetches videos from your CDN. Configure the CDN settings using environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the client directory:

```bash
# CloudFront CDN Base URL
VITE_CDN_BASE_URL=https://your-cloudfront-domain.cloudfront.net

# Transcoded videos prefix path (should match your transcoder output)
VITE_TRANSCODED_PREFIX=transcoded
```

**Default values** (if no `.env` file is provided):

- `VITE_CDN_BASE_URL`: `https://d25gw4hj3q83sd.cloudfront.net`
- `VITE_TRANSCODED_PREFIX`: `transcoded`

**URL Structure**: Videos are served from: `{CDN_BASE_URL}/{TRANSCODED_PREFIX}/{videoId}/master.m3u8`

**Example**: A video with ID `abc123` will be served from:
`https://your-cloudfront-domain.cloudfront.net/transcoded/abc123/master.m3u8`

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Adding New Features

1. **New Components**: Add them to the `src/components/` directory
2. **New Types**: Add them to `src/types/graphql.ts`
3. **New Services**: Add them to `src/lib/` directory
4. **Styling**: Use CSS modules or add styles to component-specific CSS files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Error**: Make sure your backend is running on `http://localhost:3000`
2. **CORS Issues**: Ensure your backend allows requests from `http://localhost:5173`
3. **Upload Fails**: Check that your AWS credentials are properly configured in the backend

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by opening the browser console. The client logs detailed information about:

- Upload progress
- GraphQL requests/responses
- Error messages
